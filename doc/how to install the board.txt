Development environment (installed with apt-get):
	Ubuntu 8.04 (hardy)
	Apache/2.2.8
	PHP/5.2.4
	MySQL/5.0.51a
	phpMyAdmin – needed for mysql database import

Basic Manual install: 
-Setup L/WAMP (Linux/Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
	Linux: http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_debian_lamp_server 
	Windows: http://sourceforge.net/projects/apache2triad/files/ 

Load Digaboard database scheme 
-Open phpmyadmin (http://localhost/phpmyadmin) 
-Login with the root password created during L/WAMP setup 
-Create database 
-Import 
-Browse for the digaboard-schema-<version>.sql file included in the Digaboard package 
-Submit to complete the database import
-Create a mysql user that has Select, Insert, Update, Delete privileges to the database
-Create password for mysql user

Copy over source code to web directory (do not include the “www” folder, just its contents)
-Linux: 
	/var/www/ 
-Windows(Apache2Triad): 
	C:\apache2triad\htdocs 

Edit mysql.php and enter your database connection information:
	$dbuser/$dbpass - this is the mysql username and password created in the above step
	$dbname - this is the name of the database created in the above step

Refer to the “how to use the board” document for a quick walk through of using and setting up the board (this is included with the Digaboard source package).

*Notes: 
This basic install is the minimal that is need to get Digaboard source 
code up and running on a server. To run Digaboard in production we 
recommend having an experienced Linux or Windows guru do the LAMP or 
WAMP setup. 

We do have plans to release a hardened linux virtual appliance 
pre-configured with LAMP and Digaboard. .. but we aren't quite there yet.
